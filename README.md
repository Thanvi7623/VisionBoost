Imaging in low light is challenging due to low photon count and low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). Short-exposure images suffer from noise, while long exposure can induce blur and is often impractical. A variety of denoising, deblurring, and enhancement techniques have been proposed, but their effectiveness is limited in extreme conditions. To support the development of learning-based pipelines for low-light image processing, a dataset of raw short-exposure low-light images, with corresponding long-exposure reference images is used. Using the presented dataset, a pipeline for processing low-light images is developed based on end-to-end training of a fully convolutional neural network. The network operates directly on raw sensor data and helps to obtain better results when compared to several denoising, deblurring, and enhancement techniques. The SID dataset contains 2697 raw short-exposure images, each with a corresponding long-exposure reference image taken with a Professional camera. These cameras make use of a Bayer sensor and hence produce a Bayer RAW image.
